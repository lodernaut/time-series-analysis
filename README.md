# time-series-analysis
 This tutorial is an introduction to time series forecasting using TensorFlow. It builds several different styles of models, including Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Networks (CNNs and RNNs).

• Single-step forecasting:
    // One feature.
    // All features.
• Multi-step forecasting:
    // Single-shot: Make predictions all at once.
    // Autoregressive: Make one prediction at a time and feed the output back into the model.
